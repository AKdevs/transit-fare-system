2nd meeting, June 28
1. talk about method signatures we wrote, explain what your methods will be doing if necessary

2. Q&A 
    - Ask any question about anything related to our project
    - reach out if you have any question about handout/method signatures/anything 

2. decide our main classes. Add to the repo (i.e finish setting up)

3. assign work

    3.1 find pairs
        — every class has two people working on it.

        — different combination of pairs for different classes, so everyone knows about the whole project and communicate with each other.
            pros:1.easier to find and fix problems in one class before everyone’s work merging together
                 2.easier for people working on other classes to reach out if they need some help from      
                   other class

                         e.g class1 (studentA, studentB)
                             class2 (studentA, studentC)
                             class1 (studentB, studentC)
    
    3.2 we can start coding!!!(TODO list before next meeting)
